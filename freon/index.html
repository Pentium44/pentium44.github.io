			<h1>Freon Linux: Light yet modern</h1>
			<p>Freon Linux has been brought to life for the sole purpose of being simplistic and lightweight. Freon Linux has been heavy influenced by <a href="http://www.slitaz.org/">SliTaz GNU/Linux</a> and <a href="http:///www.tinycorelinux.net/">Tiny Core Linux</a> due to being built on top of BusyBox. Freon is in early development but will be open to the community of FOSS developers.<br /> 
			Freon Linux is packaged with a hand written package manager (thaw) and its own installation scripts (freezedry). Running underneath, Freon ships with busybox as a replacement for GNU software yet still holds glibc as a C library.
			<br /><br />
			<b>Getting Freon Linux:</b>
			Presently, Freon Linux is functional. However, without a stable developed package mirror and no shipped toolchain (gcc) Freon is not practical for an everyday OS and does not hold its full potential.<br />
