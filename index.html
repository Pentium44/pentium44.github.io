	<h3>Chris's Projects</h3>
	This is a website to present my software and scripts that could be helpful to you.

		<legend>About me</legend>
		I have been programming for about 5 to 6 years and I have recently been picking up on C programming within a GNU/Linux system. In the past I have done many things with Python, Bash, and LUA but now I am focusing on becoming more fluent in C. Here is information about my programming languages<br />
		&bull; <u>Python</u>: 3 years, made IRC bots, web servers, chat clients, etc.<br />
		&bull; <u>LUA</u>: 2 years, used here and there especially when part of the minetest community.<br />
		&bull; <u>PHP</u>: 3+ years, used for most of my web based projects.<br />
		&bull; <u>Bash</u>: 5+ years, first language I ever learned.<br />
		&bull; <u>HTML</u>: 5 years, been making websites for about as long the beginning of my programming life.<br />
		&bull; <u>Javascript</u>: 3+ years, started using javascript when I needed AJAX, or dynamic page loading. Pretty fluent in this area.<br />
		&bull; <u>CSS</u>: 5 years, started learning CSS shortly after taking on HTML scripting.<br />
